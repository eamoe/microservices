## Chapter 1: Toward a Microservices Architecture

In the early 2010s, the term *microservices* emerged as a way to describe a new style of software architecture.

Microservices done well enable making software changes faster and safer at scale. Faster and safer means more agility for the business. The agility translates into better outcomes for the business and the organization.

The trick to unlocking all that value is to have the right architecture in place to support the services. It needs to reduce system costs without diminishing the value of independent services. To build that architecture it is necessary to make important decisions early. Those decisions will span methods, processes, teams, technologies, and tools. They'll also need to work together to form an emergent, optimized whole. A good way to build a system like this is through evolution.

According to James Lewis and Martin Fowler's [article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) on microservices from 2014:

> an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms... built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated machinery.

Another definition for microservices from the book *Microservice Architecture* by Irakli Nadareishvili, Ronnie Mitra, Matt McLarty, and Mike Amundsen:

> A microservice is an independently deployable component of bounded scope that supports interoperability through message-based communication. Microservice architecture is a style of engineering highly automated, evolvable software systems made up of capability-aligned microservices.

While there are lots of potential benefits to microservices, the best reason to build software this way is to reduce the coordination costs.

## Chapter 2: Designing a Microservices Operating Model

An operating model is the set of people, processes and tools that underlies the system. It shapes all the decision-making and work that we do when we build software.

In this chapter, we will cover the relationship between teams and microservices implementations with the introduction of a tool called Team Topologies.

According to Melvin Conway's finding in the [article](https://www.melconway.com/Home/pdf/committees.pdf), we can paraphrase the main thesis, called "Conway's Law":

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure. (Attributed to Frederick Brooks)

There are 3 people factors that have the biggest impact on a microservices system: team size, team skills, and inter-team coordination.

If we go too far towards team independence and autonomy, weâ€™ll introduce system-level inefficiencies and misalignment with organizational goals. If we introduce too much coordination, we risk bogging the whole system down and losing the benefits of highly changeable microservices. The challenge is to strike the right balance between independent work and coordinated efforts. That takes some experimentation and continuous tuning of your team design.

According to the Team Topology, there are 4 team types:
* Stream-Aligned
* Enabling
* Complicated-Subsystem
* Platform

Also, there are 3 interaction modes:
* Collaboration
* Facilitating
* X-as-a-service

To create a team design and Team Topology, we can follow this step-by-step approach:

1. Establish a system design team. This is a group of people who can shape the vision and behavior of the system. It designs team structures, establishes standards, incentives, and "guardrails" as well as continually improves the system.
2. Create a microservices team template for future teams. Microservices teams are expected to own one or more microservices independently. That ownership includes running the service and releasing a continuous stream of improvements, fixes, and changes as needed.
3. Define platform teams. We can instantiate a cloud platform team that offers network, application, and deployment infrastructure to the rest of the organization as a service.
4. Add enabling and complicated-subsystem teams. We can introduce a specialized release team that embodies the complicated-subsystem team type. In this case, microservices teams deliver a built and tested container. However, a microservices team may deploy its own services directly into a production environment.
5. Add key consumer teams. These could be mobile application development teams, web development teams, or even third-party organizations. In this model, the main consumer of the microservices system is the API team which is responsible for exposing the microservices to other development teams.

## Chapter 3: Designing Microservices: The SEED(S) Process

The microservices design system here is top-down, multistep methodology, and a collection of reusable processes, where each later step evolves from a previous one. Due to its evolutionary nature, it is called Seven Essential Evolutions of Design for Services or SEED(S).

The SEED(S) process provides a repeatable, reliable, and battle-tested methodology for designing service interfaces that are user-friendly and robust.

The 7 steps of the SEED(S) process are:
1. Identifying actors. Too many APIs are simply exposures of some database tables over HTTP or an attempt to provide direct networked access into application internals, via remote procedure calls (RPCs). Such approaches often struggle in delivering for customer needs and achieving business goals. Each actor must be *specific*, more so than *precise*. Actors must be defined in context. Having a company-wide "portfolio" of actors that are reused for each application design is more than an indicator of trouble. As models, actor definitions first and foremost represent the needs, pain points, and behaviors inherent to each actor archetype.
2. Identifying jobs that actors have to do
3. Discovering interaction patterns with sequence diagrams
4. Deriving high-level actions and queries based on jobs to be done (JTBDs) and the interaction partterns
5. Describing each query and action as a specification, with an open standard (such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) or GraphQL schemas)
6. Getting feedback on he API specification
7. Implementing microservices
