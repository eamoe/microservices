## Chapter 1: Toward a Microcervices Architecture

In the early 2010s, the term *microservices* emerged as a way to describe a new style of software architecture.

Microservices done well enable making software changes faster and safer at scale. Faster and safer means more agility for the business. The agility translates into better outcomes for the business and the organization.

The trick to unlocking all that value is to have the right architecture in place to support the services. It needs to reduce system costs without diminishing the value of independent services. To build that architecture it is necessary to make important decisions early. Those decisions will span methods, processes, teams, technologies, and tools. They'll also need to work together to form an emergent, optimized whole. A good way to build a system like this is through evolution.
